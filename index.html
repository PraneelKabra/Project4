    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <section class="callout">
      <h3>Hi! I am a student.</h3>
      <p>
        Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology from the Illinois Institute of Technology. While my major is in cloud computing, I have personally been focusing on the the field of cybersecurity for the past 4 years. I began exploring my interest in ethical hacking during the lockdown in 2020 and have been upskilling myself for the past 4 years by taking online courses alongside my diploma and bachelor's degree.
